# Smart Book Recommendations via Bayesian Networks - Milestone Report

## PEAS/Agent Analysis

### Problem Statement
Online book platforms face a critical challenge in predicting which books users will rate highly and which reviews will be most helpful to other customers. With millions of books available, customers rely heavily on ratings and reviews to make purchasing decisions, creating a complex recommendation environment where platforms must navigate uncertainty about user preferences while ensuring valuable reviews are highlighted.

### PEAS Framework

**Performance Measure:**
- Primary accuracy: Rating predictions within ±1 star of actual rating (accounting for subjective variation)
- Review helpfulness classification: Precision and recall for identifying helpful reviews
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average magnitude of rating prediction errors
- Model confidence intervals reflecting prediction uncertainty

**Environment:**
- Amazon Books Reviews Dataset (3GB historical data from 1995-2013)
- Static, historical snapshot environment
- Partially observable (incomplete user profiles and reading histories)
- Stochastic nature reflecting randomness in user preferences

**Actuators:**
- Rating predictions (1-5 star scale with confidence intervals)
- Helpfulness scores (binary classification with probability estimates)
- Recommendation lists (ranked books based on predicted ratings)

**Sensors:**
- User features: IDs, profile names, historical review patterns
- Book features: Genre, author, price, publication date, descriptions
- Review features: Text length, sentiment, rating, timestamp
- Social features: Helpfulness votes, total ratings count

### Why Probabilistic Modeling?

Probabilistic modeling is essential for this problem because:

1. **Inherent Uncertainty**: User preferences are subjective and influenced by factors not captured in data (mood, life circumstances, cultural background)
2. **Sparse Data**: Most users review only a small fraction of books they read, requiring probabilistic inference to fill gaps
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Reading preferences and review patterns change over time
4. **Missing Information**: Incomplete user profiles and varying amounts of review text require uncertainty handling
5. **Hierarchical Dependencies**: Natural conditional relationships between users→books→ratings that Bayesian networks model effectively

## Agent Setup, Data Preprocessing, Training Setup

### Dataset Exploration

Based on analysis of the full Amazon Books Reviews dataset (Books_rating.csv and books_data.csv):

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Total reviews**: 2,999,992 (~3 million)
- **Unique users**: 1,008,972 (~1 million)
- **Unique books**: 221,998 (~222k)
- **Average rating**: 4.22 stars
- **Time span**: 1995 to March 2013 (18 years of data)
- **Total size**: 3GB of historical review data

**Rating Distribution:**
- 5 stars: 1,807,335 (60.2%)
- 4 stars: 585,616 (19.5%)
- 3 stars: 254,295 (8.5%)
- 2 stars: 151,058 (5.0%)
- 1 star: 201,688 (6.7%)

The dataset shows significant positive skew with 60% of reviews being 5-star ratings.

### Model Architecture Choice: Discrete Bayesian Network

During implementation, we encountered a deprecation issue with pgmpy's `BayesianNetwork` class, which has been replaced by `DiscreteBayesianNetwork`. This change actually better reflects our model's nature:

- **All variables are discrete/categorical**: Review ratings (1-5), sentiment (positive/neutral/negative), user activity (low/medium/high), etc.
- **No continuous distributions**: We discretized all continuous features (review length, time, etc.) into categories
- **Explicit discrete modeling**: The new class makes it clear we're working with discrete probability distributions

### Variable Interactions and Model Structure

![Bayesian Network Structure](images/bayesian_network_structure.png)

**Key Variables and Their Roles:**

1. **User Features:**
   - `User_Activity`: Derived feature categorizing users by review count (low/medium/high)
   - Captures user engagement and experience level

2. **Book Features:**
   - `Book_Popularity`: Derived from review count per book (low/medium/high)
   - `categories`, `authors`: From books_data.csv merge when available

3. **Review Features:**
   - `Review_Length`: Categorized as short (<200), medium (200-500), long (>500 chars)
   - `Sentiment_Score`: Extracted using TextBlob (positive/neutral/negative)
   - `Time_Factor`: Recent (<6 months), moderate (6-24 months), old (>24 months) relative to dataset

4. **Target Variables:**
   - `Rating_Prediction`: 1-5 stars (main prediction target)
   - `Review_Helpfulness`: Binary classification (helpful if ≥75% found helpful)

### Model Structure Justification

The hierarchical structure captures:
- User activity influences rating patterns
- Book popularity affects rating distributions
- Review length influences sentiment expression
- Sentiment strongly predicts ratings
- Time affects review helpfulness

### Parameter Calculation Methods

All Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are calculated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on the discrete variables:

```python
P(Rating | User_Activity, Book_Popularity, Sentiment) = 
    count(Rating, User_Activity, Book_Popularity, Sentiment) / 
    count(User_Activity, Book_Popularity, Sentiment)
```

The model learned 7 CPTs total, keeping the model compact and interpretable.
